    "AI models are computer programs that aim to perform complex tasks to save us time and effort. Sometimes this is about performing something tedious for us, but fairly difficult for simple computer programs (for example, saying if an image is of a \"cat\" or a \"dog\"), but sometimes it allows us to analyse huge datasets in ways we previously couldn't (for example, detecting fraudulant credit card transactions). \n",
    "\n",
    "Most cutting-edge AI works using *neural networks*; these are massive mathematical models originally developed to imitate how our brains worked! These models work by having millions (or  billions now!) of *parameters* that change as the model learns, improving the model as training continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way a model \"learns\" is by having a *loss function*; this is a general measure of how \"well\" the model is doing. The higher the loss, the worse the model performs. Sometimes this loss is obvious (e.g. - did the model correctly guess \"cat\" for cat images?), but for more advanced models loss functions can get quite creative.\n",

List are a collection of elements. Here we are *assigning* the list to the variable `a` - this means that whenever Python \"sees\" `a`, it will `think` of the value it is assigned to.
